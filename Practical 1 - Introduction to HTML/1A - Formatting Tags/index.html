    <p><strong>Xenith</strong> is a department festival celebrated once in two years.</p>

    <p>

      17 and 18 January. During the two days, several events were organized.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xenith 2020 marked its beginning by inaugurating the exhibition titled <cite>A Glitch in Time</cite> 
      by respectable Principal <address>Dr. Rajendra Shinde</address>. An exhibition showcasing the project work 
      of the students was open to everyone for the entire day.

    </p>

    <p>
      The first talk of the fest was conducted by <address>Dr. Paritosh K. Pandya</address>, 
      an Indian Computer Scientist and a Researcher at <abbr title="Tata Institute of Fundamental Research">TIFR</abbr>, 
      on the topic <q>Intelligent Processing of Indian Music: where technology meets music</q>. 
      This <em>highly interesting</em> and well-received session witnessed a discussion about applying 
      <abbr title="Digital Signal Processing">DSP</abbr> and computational learning techniques to Indian classical music.
    </p>

    <p>
      Succeeding this, Xenith was honoured to have <address>Dr. Subhasis Chaudhuri</address>, the 
      director of <abbr title="Indian Institute of Technology">IIT Bombay</abbr>, for his talk on 
      <q>Higher Education: the perspective of an Administrator</q>. It gave a broader and better
      perspective on pursuing higher studies as a college graduate and attracted an audience in large numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Apart from these educational and insightful talks, <strong>Day 1</strong> also included innovative and 
      challenging events. One such event was <cite>Bot The Builder</cite>, a gameshow-style competition designed 
      to test <var>logic</var>, <var>creativity</var>, and <var>teamwork</var>. Teams of two metaphorically built 
      robots by solving clues and completing tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <cite>Treasure Hunt</cite> named <q>Glitch Don't Hitch</q> was also organized for people with wanderlust. 
      Participants had to face physical tasks and solve mind-boggling clues about <abbr title="Fort locality in Mumbai">Fort, Mumbai</abbr>.

    <p>
      A workshop was conducted by <cite>GreyAtom</cite> titled <q>Kung Fu Data With Pandas!</q>, which 
      introduced the use of <code>Pandas</code> â€” a high-performance, easy-to-use data analysis tool in 
      Python used by <abbr title="Data Scientists and Analysts">data professionals</abbr> for cleaning, 
      pre-processing, and extracting insights from data. Participants even tried <samp>df.describe()</samp> and <kbd>Ctrl + Enter</kbd> to run notebook cells.
    </p>
